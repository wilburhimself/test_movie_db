# Wilbur Suero take home assignment

Hi, I'm Wilbur Suero, this is my take home assignment for the fullstask engineer role at hired.

To run this project you will need to create an `.env` file at the root of this project with:

```
MOVIE_DB_API_KEY='your movie db api key'
```

I hope you like it and we talk soon.

Cheers,

Wilbur.
